## Key Features of the Program

### Apprenticeship Model  
The **Ingénieur Développement Logiciel** program is structured around a **work-study (apprenticeship) model**, and it is internationally recognized as equivalent to a Master’s degree. This allows students to alternate between academic coursework and hands-on professional experience in industry. This unique format bridges the gap between theoretical learning and practical application, ensuring graduates are fully prepared to tackle real-world challenges.

As an apprentice, I split my time between university classes and working with industry partners, allowing me to:
- Apply software engineering skills in real-time projects.
- Develop a deep understanding of professional environments, teamwork, and client interactions.
- Build a strong network of industry contacts, positioning myself for a smooth transition into the workforce.

### Key Aspects of the Program
Throughout the program, I gained expertise in various key areas of software development, combining technical knowledge with soft skills that are essential for modern engineers. Some of the **key aspects** of the program include:

- **Core Software Engineering**:  
  Solid foundations in programming languages such as **Python**, **Java**, and **C++**, as well as experience with **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **operating systems**.

- **Advanced Technologies**:  
  Specialized training in **machine learning**, **data science**, and **systems engineering**, with a focus on real-world applications in fields like automation and cloud computing.

- **DevOps and Cloud Computing**:  
  Practical skills in **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Jenkins** for continuous integration and deployment, as well as experience working with cloud platforms like **AWS**.

- **Project Management and Collaboration**:  
  Exposure to **Agile methodologies** (Scrum) and collaboration tools, preparing me to work effectively within teams in a fast-paced development environment.

- **Security and Best Practices**:  
  Emphasis on **cybersecurity** principles, including secure coding practices and encryption techniques to build robust, secure applications.

### International Experience  
As part of the program’s strong emphasis on global perspectives, I participated in an **international exchange program** at the **Czech Technical University in Prague**, focusing on **Computer Science and Statistics**.

This experience provided me with:
- Exposure to new academic environments and teaching methods.
- The opportunity to collaborate with international peers, enhancing my ability to work in multicultural teams.
- Advanced knowledge in **statistical analysis** and its applications to **data science**, complementing my software engineering background.
